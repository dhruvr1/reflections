When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    for others to see it or myself to see it from other device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    My wish.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is to steal someone's work and be honest enough to let him know about it (GitHub to GitHub).
    Clone is to copy repo from GitHub to local or from local to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    to solve conflicts while merging

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    mailing files to each other. Would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
